# ðŸ’³ Consumer Spending Time-Series Analysis

## ðŸ“° Overview
This project analyzes time-series data of anonymized purchase data from consumer credit and debit cards in the United States across 3 datasets. The datasets are split by the national level, state level, and the city level. It explores spending relations between different market category codes and consumer income in order to generate insights for data-driven action.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights
Here is a preview of some of the questions explored within this dataset. Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook in order to see how these questions were approached. Answers are at the end in the conclusion!

#### National Level
- When did the United States return to pre-pandemic levels of spending?
- What are the spending trends between the four quartiles of median income across all market category codes?
- Do these trends persist in essential categories such as spending in grocery and food stores?
- Is there a correlation between time and spending in any category code?
  
#### State Level
- In which states do the lower quantiles spend more than the higher quanrtiles relatively? Which state has the biggest difference?
- In which states do the higher quantiles spend more than the lower quanriles relatively? Which state has the biggest difference?
- In which states do the higher and lower quartiles spend roughly the same relatively?
  
#### City Level
- Which cities experienced the steepest spending declines during the beginning of lockdown?
- How did spending differ between cities with large tourist economies and cities focusing on industry and government?
